                    <h3> MISSION</h3>
                   <p>In the frenetic symphony of our modern lives, it's easy to lose ourselves in the relentless crescendo of tasks, obligations, and distractions. We become instruments playing an unfamiliar tune, the melody of our own lives fading into the background noise. It's in these moments that platforms like Three Friends offer a sanctuary, a sacred space to pause, reflect, and rediscover the harmony within.</p>
                   <h3> VISION</h3>
                   <p>Three Friends isn't just another social media platform; it's a movement, a philosophy woven into the very fabric of its being. It champions the notion that true value lies not in the frantic pursuit of external validation, but in the quiet cultivation of inner peace and meaningful connections. At its core, it emphasizes three pillars: companioning, retreats, and friendships.</p>

                       <h4> Spiritual Direction</h4>
                       <p> Spiritual direction is a practice in which an individual seeks guidance and support from a spiritual director or guide to explore and deepen their relationship with the divine, the sacred, or their own spiritual path. This process is often rooted in a particular religious or spiritual tradition, but it can also be more broadly focused on personal and existential questions.</p>

                        <p>
Retreat facilitation involves guiding and supporting individuals or groups during retreats, which are dedicated periods of time for reflection, relaxation, learning, and personal or spiritual growth. A retreat facilitator helps create and maintain a conducive environment for participants to step away from their usual routines, connect with themselves, and engage in meaningful activities. This practice is common in various contexts, including religious, spiritual, corporate, educational, or wellness settings.</p>

                        <p>Studies show that at least 1/3 of our lives are spent at work. Writer Annie Dillard famously said, “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” For many of us, a large portion of our days is spent at work; in fact, the average person will spend 90,000 hours at work over a lifetime. It’s safe to say your job can make a huge impact on your quality of life. “We spend a lot of time at work and it really affects people’s general happiness, and also life outcomes.”</p>
                        <p>Given this emphasis, we believed that our work is a place where we can enhance the experience of living. And not just going through the motions of doing tasks, checklists, deadlines and submissions, client satisfaction, etc.  And enhancing this experience does not just mean having a good time with workmates, being okay with your boss, and getting the promotion you’ve always wanted but also having the:
